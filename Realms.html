      <h1><strong>Explore the Realms</strong></h1>
      <p>
        Paths of Power takes place in a multi-dimensional universe called the Realms. Blending real-life mythologies from across the globe, the Realms contain everything from spirits to gods spread across multiple instances of Earth.<br>
        Earth is a living planet (and a background character) in PoP lore and in each realm a variation of Earth exists. Gaia exists in Orun Agbara, Terra exists in the Umbra and each incarnation of the Earth shares a synergistic relationship to one another.<br>
        Across the universe of PoP these planets act as if they are organs of an organism, the energy circulating between them binding all life and all living planets together, to create the Living Universe.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2><strong>The Primal Realm</strong></h2>
      <p>
        This is the realm Earth exists within, where strict laws of physics and reality apply. This doesn't mean that magic and special powers don't work in the Primal Realm. You just need to know how the energies flow and understand how to bend the laws of nature.<br>
        Mana, life-giving energy of creation, flows into Earth through ley lines from Orun Agbara. Likewise, Shikai, the energy of entropy, death and decay, flows through other ley lines into Earth.<br>
        When attempting to utilize magic in the Primal Realm, you must be aware of the actual amount and type of energy available in a region to work with.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2><strong>Orun Agbara</strong></h2>
      <p>
        For a realm that spawns the energies of creation, this sure is a dangerous place to be. Orun Agbara is a realm of everlasting skies. Gaia is Earth's sister in this realm and circles a Solari, or a living star-like being. Not only do the Solari provide light, but they provide the energy required for Gaia to generate Mana and they generate a dampening effect on the Gusts.
      </p>

      <h3>The Skies of Orun Agbara</h3>
      <p>
        Standing upon Earth, looking out into the sky, it is easy to imagine it stretching on forever. The skies of Orun Agbara really do stretch on forever. The Living Planets along with the Solari generate an atmosphere that calms the Winds, slowing them down into gentle currents that allow travel. Denizens of Orun Agbara travel by airship around planets, and even from planet-to-planet, upon the Winds. There is less danger from deadly solar radiation, as in the Primal Realm, but there are the Gusts. Deadly winds form with the power to rip airships to pieces, so interplanetary airships are often heavily armored with powerful propulsion systems to navigate through the Gusts.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2><strong>Umbra</strong></h2>
      <p>
        The Umbra is a realm of shadows and spirits. It is a place where the energies of death and decay are more prevalent, and where the spirits of the dead reside. The Umbra is often seen as a dark and foreboding place, but it is also a realm of great power and mystery.<br>
        In the Umbra, the laws of reality are different from those in the Primal Realm. The energies of Shikai flow freely, allowing for powerful necromantic magic and spirit communication. However, the Umbra is also home to many dangers, including malevolent spirits and powerful entities that seek to manipulate the energies of death for their own purposes; as well as, Lovecraftian eldritch beings.<br>
        Mortals live amongst the spirits of the Umbra, as well. Life thrives where Mana springs erupt, from the ley lines that flow from Earth into the Umbra. These focal points generate a protective aura that repels the most dangerous creatures, embodiments and avatars within the Umbra, which allows mortal beings to establish refuge.<br>
        Further reinforcing survivability within these hubs of life are protective gods.

      <h3><strong>Loki and the Blackheart Fortress</strong></h3>
      <p>
        Loki, the god of mischief and trickery, is a powerful figure within the Umbra. For millennia, he has ruled over the Blackheart Fortress and as the gates closed between realms, he dedicated himself to the rule and protection of his denizens. The Fortress butts up against a colossal mountain in the Frost Wastes, where Poseidon struck a ley line. Water pours directly from an Atlantean spring reinforcing the survivability of mortals in the region with warm life-giving waters.<br>
        The Frost Guard protects caravans traveling across the wastes and the Blackheart Paladins protect the walls of the Fortress. Loki's efforts and central location to other Life Springs have made survival, for mortals, possible in the Umbra.

      <h3><strong>Yomi-No-Haka</strong></h3>
      <p>
        This is a city where ancient Kami who chose not to ascend or reincarnate reside. The city consists of a large series of temples, monasteries and walled fortresses. The structures are built from a black stone common to the region, gnarlwood and intricate golden lattice decorates the edifices.<br>
        Golden Yōmei Sakura and Crimson Ginkgo trees sprout from the land as a testament to the powerful ley line that pours life force into the region.
