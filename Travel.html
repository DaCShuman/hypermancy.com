    <!-- Overview -->
    <section>
      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>
        Movement in PoP ranges from the mundane to the mythical. Whether you’re booking passage on a skyship,
        stepping through a portal, or surfing a ley-line current between Living Worlds, each method has its own
        costs, risks, and requirements.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- Mundane & Tech -->
    <section>
      <h2>Mundane &amp; Technological Travel</h2>
      <p>
        Roads, rails, suborbital hops, and starliners. Reliable—if slower—and widely available in stable regions.
        Great for commerce, caravans, and moving inconspicuously.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- Sky/Realm Ships -->
    <section>
      <h2>Skyships &amp; Realmships</h2>
      <p>
        Airborne craft that ride upon steady Gusts around the everlasting skies of Oorun Agbara. These aircraft are
        reinforced to withstand storms that whip debris from wrecked vessels and worlds, haphazardly through the deep skies regions.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- Portals & Gates -->
    <section>
      <h2>Portals, Gates &amp; Waylines</h2>
      <p>
        Ancient gates, keyed waylines, and temporary rifts allow near-instant traversal.
        Expect tolls to traverse and enter from well used routes. Alternatively, Way-Keys and rituals can attain cross Realm travel, but this is a risky venture. Once open gates will always deliver travelers towards a destination, but misaligned exits can be… unpleasant.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- Ley Lines -->
    <section>
      <h2>Ley-Line Sailing</h2>
      <p>
        Mana and Shikai channels form “currents” that seasoned navigators can ride. This fuels travel within the Primal Realm, allowing vessels with Slip Drives to phase out of the physical realm through wormholes, to ride the natural flow of energies between planets to arrive in other solar systems. 
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- Spiritual/Astral -->
    <section>
      <h2>Spiritual Transit</h2>
      <p>
        Astral projection, spirit walking, and guided crossings. Powerful for reconnaissance or diplomacy.
      </p>
