        <h2>ðŸŽ² Traits Drive the Dice Pool</h2>
        <p>MDS characters are defined by core <strong>Traits</strong>. When characters take action, these Traits determine how many dice they roll. The higher the Trait, the more dice you can throw into the fray.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <p>Traits are a measurable indicator of a character's natural capability to perform in a certain field of ability.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h3>Brawn</h3>
        <p>The measure of raw physical power, physical presence, and brute strength. Become the ultimate hunter, a juggernaut of destruction, or a master artisan!</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h3>Nimbleness</h3>
        <p>Your character's balance, reflexes, and precision of movement. The duelist, marksman and pilot find this trait to be their primary focus, though criminals and charlatans also make excellent use of their nimbleness.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h3>Toughness</h3>
        <p>The embodiment of your character's physical hardening, resilience, and resistance to physical and mental stressors. If your character is focused on survival and conditioning against environments and dangers, this is where you want to focus. Become an expert in regeneration, or simply an indominable force, the choice is up to you.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h3>Ki</h3>
        <p>When the body and soul are in phase, a powerful energy is generated. Its uses are diverse as this is the fuel for superior body control, including transformation, as well as enabling the imbuing of potions and objects with energy and magic.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h3>Smarts</h3>
        <p>A measure of knowledge, technical skill and logical problem-solving. Academics, engineers, linguists, and storytellers all find their home in this trait.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h3>Vibes</h3>
        <p>The street performer, and the investigator find this trait important. This is your character's emotional and sensory connection creating a sense of intuition that your character may rely on.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h3>Charm</h3>
        <p>Wit, persuasion, performance and presence are key factors of this Trait.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h3>Aura</h3>
        <p>This is the spiritual connection to the environment. The character's aura connects them to the greater world allowing for the use of mystical arts and magic.</p>
