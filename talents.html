      <h1>What are the <strong>Talents</strong> in the Magnitude Dice System?</h1>
    </header>

    <section>
      <p>
        Talents define a being. Do you, or do you not have the talent? If you don't, do you have the time to develop the talent?<br />
        Not many of us do, so we seek help. Talent in the MDS is designed to encourage teamwork.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>
        <strong>Well? Do you got it?</strong><br />
        Talent in the MDS ranges from negative to positive in level. Sometimes we are just too bad at something for us to engage in that activity safely.<br />
        Does it reflect on our character? Only if we let it define us. Shape us. Defeat us.<br />
        When we lack talent, we make things harder for ourselves. We don't mean to, but if we work really hard we can develop through skill building to overcome our limitations.<br />
        It is how character is developed and it is how we move forwards in life.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>
        <strong>The Mods</strong><br />
        Talent changes the Mod Factor that the character has to deal with during a situation. The Mods are a set of modifications that make things easier or harder for the character to perform.<br />
        A negative talent will make the situation worse. A positive talent will make the situation better.<br />
        The big idea is that when we have built talent in a field, actions become easier, because we naturally simplify the process through experience and knowledge.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h1>Skill Point development.</h1>
      <p class="text-green">
        Talent can be developed through practice and experience. The more we do something, the better we get at it. This is determined in game by the distribution of Skill Points when talents are employed. Skill points are delivered to the talent and used to purchase abilities from that talent’s ability trees.
      </p>
      <p class="text-red">
        There are requirements to purchase abilities and having a negative talent will prevent your character from accessing any abilities governed by that talent.
      </p>
      <p class="text-orange">
        In this way, characters are paid in respect to their actions during the Scenes of a Story. The more they apply efforts the more they are rewarded. The effect is maximized at a few points per Scene to avoid power leveling, such as purchasing enough locks to fill a room and theoretically maxing out the Crime skill by picking every lock over and over while choosing to play through downtime.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h1>Talent List</h1>
      <p>
        There are 8 talents per trait. The talents may change as play testing commences, but the idea is to cover a wide range of actions per talent.<br />
        Talents are meant to be broad in application, so that a player may be creative in their approach to a Situation.<br />
        Players are not restricted from attempting any actions, even if they have a negative talent, so they may choose to simulate a concept they have simply dreamt of, or they may very well know that a specific power exists and just have never received training in that ability, yet.<br />
        Try it out—you may be surprised by the results. The challenge will be created by the Mods. Committing to an action will incur negative modification against your roll. If you also don't have the talent, the negative rate will also apply against the Mods.<br />
        But it is all about the story and the experience. The MDS is designed to facilitate that experience and enable imagination to run wild.
