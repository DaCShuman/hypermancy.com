    <!-- Overview -->
    <section>
      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>
        Movement in PoP ranges from the mundane to the mythical. Whether you’re booking passage on a skyship,
        stepping through a gate keyed to a distant city, or surfing a ley-line current between Living Worlds, each method
        has its own costs, risks, and requirements. As with everything in MDS, <strong>Traits</strong> set your dice pools,
        <strong>Talents</strong> shape ease and options, and <strong>Mods</strong> reflect the Situation: weather, crowds,
        security, Gusts, and more.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- Mundane & Tech -->
    <section>
      <h2>Mundane &amp; Technological Travel</h2>
      <p>
        Roads, rails, ferries, suborbital hops, and starliners. Reliable—if slower—and widely available in stable regions.
        Expect tolls, manifests, inspections, and the occasional shakedown in rough territories. Great for commerce,
        caravans, and moving inconspicuously under official eyes.
      </p>
      <p class="text-muted">
        Common checks: <em>Smarts: Technology</em> (tickets, routes, maintenance), <em>Smarts: Negotiation</em> (booking, bribes),
        <em>Nimbleness: Sneak</em> (stowaway), <em>Vibes: Observation</em> (tails, traps).
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- Sky/Realm Ships -->
    <section>
      <h2>Skyships &amp; Realmships</h2>
      <p>
        Airborne craft ride steady winds—or brave the dreaded <em>Gusts</em>—between cities and even worlds. Realmships are
        reinforced to survive inter-realm currents and employ navigators who can read windshears, mana tides, and Shikai
        eddies. Passage is faster than roads, pricier than portals, and safer than raw ley-surfing—usually.
      </p>
      <p class="text-muted">
        Common checks: <em>Nimbleness: Pilot/Ride</em> (helm), <em>Smarts: Engineering</em> (repairs), <em>Vibes: Observation</em> (weather),
        <em>Ki: Kinesics</em> (fine control in turbulence). Mods spike during storms, dogfights, or low-visibility.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- Portals & Gates -->
    <section>
      <h2>Portals, Gates &amp; Waylines</h2>
      <p>
        Ancient gates, keyed waylines, and temporary rifts allow near-instant traversal. Expect fees, keys, sigils,
        permissions, or alignment windows. Miskeyed exits risk disorientation or hostile territory. Stable city gates are
        heavily regulated; wild rifts appear where energies surge or reality thins.
      </p>
      <p class="text-muted">
        Common checks: <em>Aura: Presence</em> (stabilize), <em>Aura: Kinetics</em> (shear dampening), <em>Smarts: Lore</em> (glyphs),
        <em>Charm: Guile</em> (permits). <strong>Resonance</strong> and <strong>Psyche</strong> often mitigate jump-sickness.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- Ley Lines -->
    <section>
      <h2>Ley-Line Sailing</h2>
      <p>
        Mana and Shikai channels form “currents” that seasoned navigators can ride on foot, in gliders, or aboard tuned craft.
        Fast and elegant, but volatile during storms or near contested nodes. Lines may fork; inexperienced crews can get swept
        into dangerous regions—or stranger places between.
      </p>
      <p class="text-muted">
        Common checks: <em>Smarts: Lore</em> (maps & nodes), <em>Ki: Kinesics</em> (balance & flow), <em>Aura: Kinetics</em> (current shaping).
        <strong>Resonance</strong> helps read flows; <strong>Phase</strong> empowers bodily attunement.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- Spiritual/Astral -->
    <section>
      <h2>Spiritual Transit</h2>
      <p>
        Astral projection, spirit walking, psychopomp caravans, and ancestor routes through the Umbra. Superb for reconnaissance,
        diplomacy, or bypassing physical blockades. Bodies must be guarded; tethers (anchors) must be maintained. Predatory entities
        stalk the unwary.
      </p>
      <p class="text-muted">
        Common checks: <em>Aura: Psionics</em> (focus), <em>Vibes: Attunement</em> (safe paths), <em>Toughness: Resolution</em> (hold form).
        <strong>Psyche</strong> buffers mental strain; <strong>Resonance</strong> improves spirit-world clarity.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- Mechanics hooks -->
    <section>
      <h2>Using Travel at the Table (Hooks)</h2>
      <ul style="text-align:left; margin: 0 auto; max-width: 70ch;">
        <li><strong>Time scales:</strong> Road days; skyship hours; portal moments; ley-line minutes (variable); spirit travel subjective.</li>
        <li><strong>Costs:</strong> Road (low), skyship (medium), realmship (high), portal (tolls/keys), ley sailing (gear/guide), spiritual (offerings/anchors).</li>
        <li><strong>Checks/Contests:</strong> Choose a leading Trait+Talent per mode; apply <em>Mods</em> for weather, regulations, crowds, Gusts, rift stability, etc.</li>
        <li><strong>Complications:</strong> Delays, inspections, storms, misalignment, predators, shortages, sabotage.</li>
        <li><strong>Power Factors:</strong> Spend <em>Resonance</em> to sense safe nodes; <em>Phase</em> for balance; <em>Psyche</em> to resist disorientation; <em>Charge</em> to overclock engines.</li>
      </ul>
