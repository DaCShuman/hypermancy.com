                    PoP is the next generation of tabletop roleplaying games, allowing players to achieve infinite levels of power and mastery. <br> 
                    The Paths of Power of Power universe features the Magnitude Dice System and a rich and robust universe,<nobr></nobr><br> 
                    set in a sci-fi/fantasy setting. <br> </p>

                        Paths of Power features a living universe where everything has a function and purpose. Each realm exists to serve a vital function for the cosmos, or in reflection of the True Will <br>
                        Sentient beings have been forced to compete with malevolent entities, monsters, and horrors for eons. <br>
                        For 22,000 years, give or take, Sol system has been isolated from this game of intrigue. We have been spared from the suffering of the rest of the galaxy, only to be subjugated by beings who would corrupt us and turn us into good servants. <br>
                        Earthlings have lost access to ancient knowledge. We have had our psyche shocked and shattered after ages of manipulation. We have nearly lost our souls to madness. <br>
                        In the midst of passionate death throes, the planet would choose several heroes to empower. Granted incredible power, they lash out against the onslaught of evil and shatter the barrier that holds Earth from the rest of reality. <br>
                        Once again Earth is reconnected with the rest of the Milky Way, and beyond. Pathways, closed for millennia, are once again reopening. Travel between the Realms is becoming possible, but danger exists within the long forgotten Weys, hallways, and hedges between these realms.  <br>
                        Become a part of the excitement, an adventurer seeking out the truth of why Earth had been cast into a void, or perhaps as a star vessel commander, smuggling or exploring the vast reaches of the Undead Sectors. <br>
                        The Choice is yours...
