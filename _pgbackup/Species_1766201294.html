            <h1>Species of the Realms</h1> 
            <section> 
                <p>
                Every species develops genetic advantages and disadvantages based on its evolutionary history. A species from a planet with extreme heat or cold will be adept at handling those environments, but less capable in the opposite. Other traits may also emerge; for example, a species that evolved on a densely forested planet with predatory flora and fauna will naturally develop stealthier habits. In PoP, species possess advantages and disadvantages that affect Mods. During Character Creation, these are calculated as Evolution Points (EP), which account for both social and genetic traits. </p>
                <h2>
                    A Core Principle </h2>
                <p>
                    To be absolutely clear, Hypermancy Studios does not tolerate or condone bigotry, racism, slavery, or any ideology that claims the superiority of one being above another. These forms of ignorance have no place in our game worlds or our community.<br>
                    Every species and lineage in our setting is designed to enrich storytelling, celebrate diversity, and explore unique strengths and challenges. Crucially, no species is inherently superior. Differences exist solely to grant unique narrative pathways and mechanical choices, never to reinforce harmful real-world prejudices.</p>
                <h2>The Living Planets</h2>
                <p>The universe of <b>Paths of Power</b> is not merely space, but a living, sentient entity. It gives birth to stars, which in turn nurture the development of life. The Living Planets&#8212;Earth among them&#8212;are the direct children of these stars.<br>
                These Planets are distinct entities, possessing their own will and desires separate from the universe at large. They actively shape the life within their biospheres.<br>
                When a Living Planet is born, reflections manifest in the Umbra and the Wylde. Together, they create a symbiotic trio, each striving to thrive within its respective realm. Consequently, every species naturally evolved on a world bears the mark of its mother planet, manifesting as unique genetic characteristics.<br>                     
                <h2>The Beings of the Primal Realm</h2>
                <h3>Humans</h3>
                <p>
                    An ancient forerunner of modern humanity, a member of the Chosen, took great care through the early ages of our universe to seed the early human genetic code across many planets. For this reason, humanity exists as one of the standard beings across the Realms, with a pliable genetic structure that is capable of thriving in diverse topographies and extreme biospheres. 
                    A few ancient lineages of humanity remain; the Malorians and the Ravalothians both claim to hail directly from the Chosen.  </p>
                <h3>Orcish</h3>
                <p>
                    The Ogryn created the Orcs as specialized warriors, capable of operating independently from their armies. The Orcs have since evolved beyond this to become the Ogryn's greatest enemy. Orcs are amongst the greatest of the warrior species in the Primal Realm, specializing in hunting and destroying psychic and magical threats. </p>
                <h3>Woormars</h3>
                <p>
                    Individually, a Woormar is merely a small, psychic eel. Together, they are a legion. These creatures possess the ability to physically and mentally merge, increasing their mass to mimic the sentient races they encounter. Through this collective form, they simulate biological functions like speech and strength. However, because their true appearance is a writhing mass of coils, they often hide within heavy armor or robes to blend in with civilized society. </p>
                <h3>Gray Elves/Grays</h3>
                <p>
                    The Gray Elves—or simply 'The Grays'—are the tragic byproduct of existence within the void of Primal Space. Trapped within the Sol Shard, they are severed from the Wylde and the nourishing flow of Mana. Once the 'Sky Beings' who guided humanity, they were forced to retreat to the Lunar Shard following a treaty with the demonic powers of Earth after the Renaissance. Over centuries, this isolation and mana starvation triggered a biological metamorphosis, twisting them into the 'Gray Aliens' of modern conspiracy. </p>
                <h3>The Vampyr: Arisen</h3>
                <p>
                    The Arisen are the "True Vampyr"—humans who died but refused to accept the void. Through a terrifying act of sheer will, they denied death and resurrected themselves. They are the source of the bloodline, possessing potent blood and the unique venom required to create others. In vampire society, they are royalty, though many hide their true nature; to be an Arisen is to be a target for those seeking to steal their power. </p>
                <h3>The Vampyr: Reborn</h3>
                <p>
                    The Reborn are the "Turned"—mortals resurrected through the chemical intervention of an Arisen. Prepared over weeks with venom injections and finally birthed through the "Embrace," they die and rise again. While they possess the supernatural abilities of their sires, they lack the raw, independent will that created the Arisen. They are the soldiers and courtiers of the night. </p>
                <h3>Ghouls</h3>
                <p>
                    The byproduct of a failed Embrace. A Ghoul was mutated by venom but never truly died to complete the resurrection. They are a "leaky vessel," constantly bleeding out Mana. Unlike Vampyrs, who sip blood, Ghouls must consume raw, living flesh to slow their eternal decay. </p>
                <h3>Strigoi</h3>
                <p>
                    A horrific mutation caused by the Eastern Bloodworm. When this parasite infects a host, it consumes their Mana. To survive, the host undergoes a metamorphosis, developing a proboscis to drain blood. They are less a person and more a vehicle for the parasite’s hunger. </p>
                <h2>Species of the Wylde Realm, Orun Agbara</h2>
                <p>
                    Life in the Wylde is defined by an abundance of Mana and flourishing creation. But this vibrancy hides a dark truth: an existence tipped too far toward Yang breeds madness. Without the grounding influence of Yin, creation becomes obsession, and passion becomes gluttony. This is the balance maintained by the flows of Mana and Shikai energies.
                    Nowhere is this clearer than in the Fae. They have become beings of unquenchable hunger and limitless desire. In a healthy universe, the Umbra would flush Shikai energy through the realm, washing away this excess and tempering the Fae’s wild nature, in cycles. But on Gaia, the separation of the realms has stopped this cleansing cycle. Trapped in a feedback loop of pure creation, the Fae have grown monstrous, enslaved by their own limitless power and appetites  
                <h3>Elves: Fae-kin</h3>
                <p>
                    Elves are the human variant of the Wylde Realm. Evolved under Gaia's influence and an abundance of Mana, this lineage developed a natural sensitivity to magic, resulting in gaunt frames, high metabolisms, and long life spans. The Fae-kin are the soldiers of the Faerie Nobility. Fiercely loyal and nearly as cruel as their masters, they are adept in both martial combat and elemental magic, using these skills to hunt down the enemies of the Fae wherever they may hide.  
                <h3>Dark Elves</h3>
                <p>
                    The Dark Elves are refugees who fled the Fae Courts when the 'Madness' began to sweep the kingdoms. They took shelter in strongholds where Shikai energies bled through the barrier from Earth, learning to harness entropy and death to gain an edge against the Fae. Over time, exposure to these energies physically altered them, first bleaching and then darkening their skin. Though not inherently evil, the toll of war and entropy has hardened their minds. They are ruthless survivalists; their priests and priestesses have mastered necromancy, raising armies of the fallen to strike back at the Fae.  
                <h3>Void Elves</h3>
                <p>
                    When the Sol System was severed from the universe, these Elves were left drifting on the other side. Known as Void Elves, they have spent thousands of years aboard Craftworlds—colossal starships housing the refugees of the Realms. Because they retained their link to Mana, they escaped the horrific fate of the Grays, though the void has still left its mark: generations of low gravity have stretched their frames into tall, slender silhouettes. Masters of starship technology, they are frequently sought after as void navigators and engineers.    
                <h3>Nosferatu</h3>
                <p>
                    The tragic fate of an Elf who succumbs to vampirism. Whether due to their unique biology or high mana potential, the necrotic transition twists them violently. The ethereal beauty of the Elf is warped into a jagged, horrific monstrosity. They are powerful, but they wear their curse on their skin. </p>
                <h2>Species of the Umbra</h2>
                <p>
                    The Umbra is a realm of dark reflections, dominated by entropy and decay. Dark stars radiate seething pulses of Shikai energy, bathing the landscape in necrotic power. Here, mortal natives exist alongside the restless spirits of the Primal Realm, constantly fighting to survive the nameless horrors of the Abyss.
                    The geography is as unforgiving as the inhabitants: a single, massive supercontinent bound by crushing gravity. While this pressure debilitates outsiders, it has acted as an evolutionary crucible for native species, breeding beings of terrifying durability and physical strength. <h3>Dwarves</h3> <p>
                    Dwarves are the Umbral reflection of humanity, seeded upon the dark expanse of Terra. Much like in Earth folklore, they are short and stout—a direct result of evolving under the crushing gravity of the Umbra. While not notably nimble, their density makes them incredibly tough. In fact, Dwarves who travel to lighter realms like Earth or Gaia possess immense brawn and can perform incredible vertical leaps.
                    They live in tight-knit communal societies, dwelling within elaborate fortresses carved deep into mountains to survive the harsh environment. Renowned as masters of science, technology, and construction, they use this industrial expertise to negotiate for power and influence within organizations across the Realms. </p> <h3>Others to Come</h3> <p>
                    In due time, more species and lineages from the Primal Realm will be listed... And yes, there will be much more diversity soon, rather than just human variants and vampires. Therians are the "beast" races of the Primal and Wylde realm. Veyrith are the descendants of the dinosaurs. Grendel-kin are beings of monstrous appearance from the Umbra. There are devils and more infernal creatures from the fiery realm: Gehenna. Demons are spirit-like entities that inhabit mortals, turning them into a special type of insidious creatures that plague the realms.
                    This is really to give an idea of the flavor of lore that Paths of Power brings to the table, as we prepare for an Alpha test of the rules, with limited groups of players.  </p>
